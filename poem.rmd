## First Verse   
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves   
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe.

“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!

## Second Verse   
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

## Third Verse   
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

"The sun was shining on the sea,
      Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
      The billows smooth and bright —
And this was odd, because it was
      The middle of the night.

The moon was shining sulkily,
      Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
      After the day was done —
"It's very rude of him," she said,
      "To come and spoil the fun."

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

In the heart's quiet chamber, love takes flight,
A gentle whisper in the still of night.
It paints the world in hues of gold and blue,
A melody of dreams that ring so true.

Love's tender touch, a feather-light caress,
Brings warmth and comfort, banishes distress.
In every glance exchanged, a story told,
Of passion's fire, a treasure to behold.

Through trials faced and challenges untold,
Love's steadfast presence, a hand to hold.
In laughter's echo and in tears' embrace,
Love finds its way, a sacred place.

It blooms in springtime's blossoms, fresh and new,
And in the autumn's hues, a deeper hue.
In winter's chill, it sparks a warming fire,
Love's gentle flame, a heart's desire.

From dawn's first light to twilight's gentle kiss,
Love's symphony plays on, an endless bliss.
For in the tapestry of life's grand design,
Love's threads entwine, forever intertwined.
